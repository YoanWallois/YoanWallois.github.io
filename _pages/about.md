Welcome
======
As a Ph.D. in Economics and Data Scientist, I specialize in harnessing the power of data—whether structured or unstructured—to generate original insights, deepen understanding, and forecast trends across diverse domains. My research and professional work revolve around the intersection of econometrics, machine learning, and text mining, with a particular focus on environmental policy, climate economics, and financial markets. By combining advanced quantitative techniques (Python, R, STATA) with innovative methodologies such as dynamic data visualization, web scraping, and natural language processing, I transform raw data into actionable intelligence.

My recent work centers on the quantitative analysis of environmental and climate policies, with a methodological emphasis on text mining, machine learning, and econometric evaluation. A key contribution is the development of a globally scalable index measuring environmental policy stringency, which synthesizes insights from over 70,000 legislative texts to assess regulatory impacts and inform climate action. By integrating computational techniques with economic theory, I aim to bridge gaps between policy design, empirical evidence, and market responses—whether evaluating the effects of extreme weather events on policy adoption or analyzing sentiment in financial discourse. This work not only advances academic debate but also equips institutions and firms with tools to navigate the transition to a low-carbon economy.

Beyond technical proficiency, I bring a researcher’s curiosity, a consultant’s pragmatism, and a communicator’s clarity to every project. Whether collaborating with academic peers, advising policymakers, or supporting strategic decision-making in the private sector, I thrive at the nexus of theory and application. My goal is not only to answer pressing questions but to frame new ones, leveraging data-driven approaches to deliver measurable value. I am particularly passionate about projects that demand interdisciplinary thinking, where econometric precision meets machine learning innovation to solve real-world challenges
