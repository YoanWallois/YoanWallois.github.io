The lecture on "Growth Economics" in macroeconomics focuses on the modeling and theoretical foundations of long-run economic growth. It begins with the Malthusian model, illustrating how population dynamics and diminishing returns constrained pre-industrial economies. The course then explores the Solow model, emphasizing capital accumulation, technological progress, and the golden rule for optimal savings. Moving beyond exogenous growth, it introduces endogenous growth theory with the Barro and Romer models, highlighting the roles of human capital, innovation, and policy in sustaining long-term growth. The mathematical framework relies on differential equations, dynamic optimization, and steady-state analysis. Finally, the course examines the role of institutions in shaping growth trajectories, providing a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that drive economic development.
