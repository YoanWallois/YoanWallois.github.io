The lecture on "Macroeconomics of Unemployment and Inflation" focuses on modeling the interactions between inflation, unemployment, and macroeconomic policy. It explores key frameworks such as the Phillips curve, the NAIRU (Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment), and critiques. The course requires mathematical tools like dynamic equations, expectation modeling, and equilibrium analysis to formalize economic relationships. The aim is to provide students with a deep understanding of how inflation and unemployment evolve, the effectiveness of economic policies, and the theoretical debates shaping macroeconomic thought.
