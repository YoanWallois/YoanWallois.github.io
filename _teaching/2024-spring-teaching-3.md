The lecture on "Estimation Methods" in econometrics focuses on statistical modeling techniques used for parameter estimation in economic data analysis. It covers fundamental methods like Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), Nonlinear Least Squares, and the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM), emphasizing their assumptions, properties, and inference capabilities. The course requires a strong mathematical foundation in probability theory, statistical inference, and asymptotic theory to ensure rigorous estimation and hypothesis testing. It also incorporates practical applications using the R software, allowing students to implement estimation techniques through hands-on examples. The objective is to equip students with a comprehensive toolkit for addressing econometric issues, handling violations of classical assumptions, and applying advanced estimation techniques in empirical research.
